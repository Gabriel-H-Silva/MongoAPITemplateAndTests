# Web API Architecture

This project serves as a template to facilitate the development of new Web API projects with MongoDB communication features. It provides a basic framework to perform CRUD operations by default and also includes a project for testing with XUnix TDD.

To get started, simply add the connection string for MongoDB and adjust the models as needed.
