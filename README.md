# Initial REST API Architecture

This project serves as a template for establishing a REST API with MongoDB communication capabilities. It provides a basic structure to perform CRUD operations, with the following components:

Controller: Manages data input and output.
Business/Interface: Handles data processing.
Repository/Interface: Manages database interactions, limited to simple methods for executing events as determined by the Business layer.
Models:

OM (Object Model): Represents the data model for the database.
IM (Interface Model): Defines the data model interface.
To get started, simply add the connection string for MongoDB and adjust the models as needed.
